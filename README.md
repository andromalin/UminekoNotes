## **Episode 2: Turn of the Golden Witch**

```
Good morning. The Golden Witch eagerly awaits your arrival.
Please do grant her that wish.

Were you able to get a good rest and perfect your strategy?
The witch expects a lot from you, and is more than ready to
launch an assault right from the start.
I also look forward to seeing your strategy.

The difficulty level is extreme.
The witch intends to make you surrender all at once.

- ###### **Six Victims:**

	**Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie**

	- ###### That Night, Presumably:

		- The six victims (Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie) were in the dining hall, after chasing out the children, Nanjo, and all the servants except for Genji
		- At some point, the victims presumably end up in the chapel
```diff
- Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, the six definitely entered through the door
```
		- At some point, the victims presumably accept Beatrice as a witch
		- At some point, the victims presumably end up dead
		- Eventually, the victims' final state is inside the chapel, with their stomachs cut open, and filled with candy

	- ###### 6:00:

		- Kinzo and the servants, (Genji, Gohda, Kanon, and Shannon), are awake, and the servants go about their duties, until Shannon notices a memo in dining hall, pointing to the chapel, then Genji heads to Rosa's room, wakes her up, and tells her something happened at the chapel
		- Rosa heads to the chapel with Genji, where Gohda, Shannon, and Kanon awaits, Rosa sees the magic circle on the chapel's door, and questions the servants about it, and Gohda explains they dont know when it was drawn, while Shannon adds that she was the first to discover it
		- After noticing the "Happy Halloween Maria" message below the magic circle, Rosa asks if they checked on Maria, which Genji says they still haven't
		- Rosa then questions the servants about how she was the one being told of this incident instead of a higher ranked family member like Krauss, and they explain that they couldn't find Krauss nor Natsuhi
		- Rosa asks if the servants had tried to check inside the chapel yet, Kanon says they haven't yet, and Genji explains that the lock to the chapel is special, and the one and only key which can open it is missing from the servants' key box
		- Rosa tries opening the door to the chapel, but finds it locked, Kanon then suggests breaking one of the windows to enter the chapel, but Rosa won't let them do that to Kinzo's chapel
		- On a hunch about the contents of Maria's letter, Rosa heads back to the guesthouse and sneaks into the room where the children (Battler, George, Jessica, and Maria) are sleeping
		- Rosa finds a key inside Maria's letter, returns to the chapel, and Genji confirms the key she holds is the one for the chapel door
		- Rosa uses the chapel key to open the door to the chapel, where she and the servants finds the corpses of the six victims, then she tells Genji and Shannon to ask Kinzo for instructions, while Gohda and Kanon should call the police and get Nanjo to the chapel

	- 

		- In the children's room, Maria wakes up, notices the contents of her letter being missing, wakes up the other children, and they reach the conclusion that Rosa must have taken it
		- The children head to the parlor after being unable to find anybody else in the mansion, noticing even the servants room and the kitchen being empty
		- George asks Battler to confirm if he is sure that it was Rosa who took the letter, and Battler states that he's not entirely confident, but gets the impression that Rosa was fishing around in Maria's handbag at dawn
		- The children then run into Nanjo, and ask him if he knows where their parents went, but as he has only just woken up, he doesn't know
		- Gohda and Kanon then come running by, with Gohda heading to the servants room, while Kanon approaches Nanjo and asks him to accompany him to the chapel
		- The children follow Kanon and Nanjo, and on the way notice Gohda in the servants room, trying to make a phone call
		- Kanon and Nanjo and the children following along arrive at the chapel, and discover the bodies of the six victims

	- > Beatrice confronts Battler about his claims in the previous game, where he argued that because the faces of the corpses were obscured, the identities of the corpses couldn't truly be confirmed, which opens up many theories

	- > Beatrice points out that with the state of the six victims this time, with their faces completely intact, those theories, including ones built around a fake autopsy by an accomplice, have been denied

		- Gohda returns to the chapel, with the news that the phones have broken down, leaving him unable to call the police
		- Jessica runs off to confront the mystery guest Beatrice, and Rosa tells Gohda and Kanon to follow her
		- George and Battler discuss the Beatrice's identity, as Battler notes that he hasn't even seen her face, which Maria corrects him on, as her face decorates the portrait in the mansion
		- Maria then declares the ceremony to open the door to the golden land as having begun, and that the six victims are sacrifices for that goal
		- Maria goes "Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!"
			(listen, i Had to add this okay, it's Very important imo)
		- George finds a sealed letter on the table in the chapel, addressed "To those that remain", with a message from Beatrice, proclaiming her intentions of collecting Kinzo's belongings, with interest, and the special clause that will negate her collection if Kinzo's gold is found
		- George notices three 10 kg gold bars, inscribed with the family crest, on the table

		- Genji and Shannon report to Kinzo in his study, about the six deaths, and of Rosa's orders, but he doesn't care what his children are doing
		- Kinzo relieves Genji and Shannon of their duties towards him, which they decline, then Kinzo decides to write a will, and asks Shannon to copy what he says, and for Genji to make his usual drink
		- Gohda returns to the chapel, reports to Rosa that Kanon is currently looking after Jessica, and everybody (Battler, George, Gohda, Maria, Nanjo, and Rosa) leaves the chapel
		- Outside the chapel, Battler, George, Maria, and Nanjo discover the magic circle on the chapel door
			- GOHDA states "When we first found this, the magic circle was already drawn here"
		- The children and adults and Gohda all discuss the chapel's significance to Kinzo, until Rosa has a realization, and asks Gohda to confirm what Genji said about there only being one chapel key
			- GOHDA states "It's the key to Master KINZO's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates"
			- ROSA states "That's right. And GENJI-san said that it had gone missing..."
		- Battler, George, and Rosa realize this doesn't add up, based on their knowledge of Maria having held on to the key since yesterday
		- Rosa checks the door's lock and goes through her motions at the time, to confirm her own actions
			- ROSA states "There's no mistake! It was closed!! I opened it!! Definitely!!"
			- ROSA states "Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door, it was definitely locked!!"

	- > Beatrice challenges Battler to explain the chapel's closed room with human actions, rather than her magic, which Battler argues is impossible to do, because there's not enough information to accurately guess anything

	- > Battler claims that the premise of a closed room is a "Devil's Proof", as you can only truly prove that a room *isn't* closed, while the potential methods of entering a room is endless, and just because he wasn't able to discover an entry method himself, that doesn't prove no such method exists

	- > Beatrice denies Battler's argument that a human method of entry could exist, because because magic that could truly close a room is real, and Battler denies Beatrice's argument that a magic method of entry could exist, because he claims that magic that could truly close a room isn't real, and with both of them denying the basis of each other's arguments, they arrive at a stalemate

	- > Beatrice and Battler both agree that they wouldn't accept a draw, so Beatrice introduces a new rule, one which will eliminate the ability to deny the basics of arguments, because endless evasive answers would be too boring for Beatrice

```diff
- Everything I speak in red is the truth
```

	- > Battler questions the premise, but Beatrice insists that the rules of a game are sacred, and those who take the rules lightly are not qualified to play, and so Battler agrees to play along with the rule, rather than being stuck in an endless draw, and they return to the challenge of the chapel's closed room, using the new rule, with Battler claiming a hidden door was used to get the six victims into the chapel

```diff
- Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, the six definitely entered through the door
```

	- > Battler asks for proof, but Beatrice reminds him that since the basis of her arguments rest on the claim that magic is real, the proof is self-evident, and she supplements the new rule with "I will not bear the responsibility of establishing that claim by showing proof", so they can get back to the game
